  is a large and powerful dog breed with a noble and intimidating presence.
  <br>They were originally used for guarding royalty and nobility in feudal Japan.
  <br>These dogs also tracked and hunted wild boar, black bear, and sometimes deer.
  The Akita does not back down from challenges and does not frighten easily</p>
