  Hello<br>
  My name is <strong>san(s-ahn)</strong><br>
  I moved to America with my family in 2016, from Korea.<br>
  I'm a little shy, but very friendly. <br>
  I do well with other dogs who behave, but sometimes don't like small children,<br>
  especially if they're loud or try to touch me unexpectedly.<br>
  I'm not a fan of cats, they look at me funny
</p>
